	The Fibonacci numbers are defined by
	\[F_1 = 1,F_2=1,F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_n\]
	<br><span class="points">[ 15 points ]</span> What is the smallest positive integer n such that \(F_n\), the nth fibonacci number, has 2,0,1,8 as the second, third, fourth and fifth digits respectively?
	<br><span class="points">[ 30 points ]</span> What is the smallest positive integer n such that \(F_n\), the nth fibonacci number, has 2,0,1,8,2,0,1,8 as the second through to nineth digits respectively?

	n! (n factorial) is defined recursively as \(0!=1\) and \(n!=(n-1)!\times n\) for \(n\geq1\). The number of trailing zeros in a decimal number is the number of zeros with no non-zero digits following it; for example \(13!=6227020800\) has exactly 2 trailing zeros as the last two digits are 0 but the third-last is not. It is possible for n! to have 1 trailing zero; for example, \(7!=5040\) has exactly one trailing zero. It is also possible for n! to have 10, 100, 1000 trailing zeros. However, there exist powers of ten such that n! never has exactly 100...00 trailing zeros.
	<br><span class="points">[ 10 points ]</span> What is the exponent, k, of the smallest power of ten such that n! never has exactly \(10^k\) trailing zeros?
	<br><span class="points">[ 35 points ]</span> What is the exponent, k>2018 , of the smallest power of ten greater than \(10^{2018}\) such that n! never has exactly \(10^k\) trailing zeros?
