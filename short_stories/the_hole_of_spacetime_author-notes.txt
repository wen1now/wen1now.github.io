Unfortunately there have been a few misinterpretations of this piece due to fallacies regarding black holes. Black holes radiate energy in the form of Hawking radiation; smaller black holes radiate more energy than larger ones (does this clear anything up?). Also I am fully aware that the black hole would not radiate energy forever - only for a year or so before it explodes.

More critically though, I feel that there are a few logic gaps in the story although those are rather unobvious and have been glossed over (have fun finding them).

The story itself seems of decent quality although I felt like I was being repetitive with nomenclature (i.e 'professor little replied...the professor said...professor little...' for example). I hope that wasn't too glaringly clear.
