yes, i know capitally isn't a word
this task was for the 2018 qcs writing exam; task was on 'connectness' with  a bunch of stimuli that i thoughtfully neglected to provide here. since i didn't have enough time to copy down what i actually wrote in the exam, the general gist remains (and the first five paragraphs or so are from the actual exam too, although those have been lightly edited)

sorry it's so introspective.
make of the ending what you will.
